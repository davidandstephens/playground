# playground

This playground repository is meant to resharpen skills, as well as have a bit of fun. Here you'll be able to find:

 - A rock, paper, scissors game using Document Manipulation with ECMAScript 6 (Got too used to jQuery), and Skeleton.css.
 
 - A magic meatball that gives dinner suggestions, as well as links to recipes.
 
 More projects to come in the future.
